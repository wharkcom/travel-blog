Over Christmas, posted on facebook that we bought a truck.

Lots of questions about why we got it and what we're planning, so here it is:

<ul class="fa-ul list-center">
<li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-check-square"></i></span>Step 1. Buy a truck.</li>
<li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-spinner fa-pulse"></i></span>Step 2. Buy an RV.</li>
<li><span class="fa-li"><i class="far fa-square"></i></span>Step 3. ???</li>
<li><span class="fa-li"><i class="far fa-square"></i></span>Step 4. Profit.</li>
</ul>

It's a bit of a long story to explain how we got here. If you don't want to read all of that, here's the summary.

<div class="boxed-text">
tl,dr; Buying an RV, spending a year on the road. Leave in June from PA. Head noth east. July 4th in Maine. Acadia NP. West?

The beginnings - started sailing post grad school. discovered sailing blogs and people traveling around the world. Declared my 5 year plan was to do the same. Loved the idea of traveling, exploring, and not waiting until a retirement that may never come. Actually started sailling, did some vacations, saving money, and on track. 

~3 years later - getting antsy and start talking about seriously getting a boat and starting to travel. Sushila says no. Like seriously no. I was disappointed, but still had an itch to do something. Almost on a whim, suggested that we go RVing instead. Sushila thought about it and said, "Yeah, I guess we could do that." 

The plan started as a few months, maybe up to 6 months, before we'd head back to our jobs. We started looking at itineraries, though, and realized we'd need longer to see all that we wanted. Exploring Alaska is something we both really wanted to do, and fitting that in extended our plan to a year.

At this point, we don't have a firm itinerary for anything. I'd like to keep it that way as much as possible. I don't want the stress and pressure of being tied to a plan or forced to go faster/slower than we want at any given time just to meet a schedule that we think makes sense right now. For detailed plans, I'd like to keep it to no more than 2 weeks to 1 month in advance. Want the freedom to discover places that we'd otherwise have passed by.

That said, our very rough plan is as follows:
* Summer 2018: North East (ME, NH, VT, NY, MI)
* Fall 2018: North West (MN, SD, ND, MT, ID, WA, OR, WY)
* Winter 2018: South (CA, AZ, NM, UT, TX, LA, FL)
* Spring 2019: Whatever we've missed
* Summer 2019: Alaska!

On that route, we want to visit as many National Parks as possible. One of my bucket-list goals is to visit all 59 of them. We won't be able to do that in a single trip (even if it's a year long), but we can probably get close. We'll also visit as many National Monuments/Forests and State Parks/Forests as can. We'll also stop to visit as many friends and family as we can. We would absolutely love to have people visit while we're traveling, so if anyone is interested in meeting us at a particular time or location, let us know and we'll get something planned.


-------------------------------------
Notes:
No kids, no mortage, jobs and skill sets that would let us work remotely, and enough money saved to get started.

Steps - Profit -- Center, use fa icons, some extra styling

tl,dr; add some styling to this to offset it.

Will use this blog to record our progress as we prepare and then record our travels once we've set off. Hopefully this will let all those who are interested follow along.
